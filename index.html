      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am currently a student of Purdue Global University working on my bachelor's degree of Information Technology
        and Computer Science with a focus on Multi-platform software development. I plan on progressing through to a PH.D
        in Computer Science. While I am taking classes and working on this degree path I am pursuing a career in web and
        app development and working on starting my own small development business. I also aspire to start up my own Indie gaming
        label and will incorporate all of this into one tech company under a single brand.</p>

        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>As a web designer I am responsible for creating attractive and aesthetically pleasing websites.
          I use an array of programs and skills to help me with this task such as Photoshop for wire frames and layouts as
          well as Illustrator for custom graphics when needed.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>As a web Developer I build the backbone of the website. I take what the designers have created and breathe
          life into the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP name a few. I make all the elements
          of the website come to life and function the way it needs to.</p>
